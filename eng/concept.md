# Concept

`Daily Money One` (DMO) uses accounting concepts to record transactions, consisting of three main elements: Book, Account, and Transaction.

## Book

> A Book is the foundation of accounting. All accounts within a book must use the same currency. You can create multiple books to manage finances in different currencies as needed.

## Account

> Accounts are categorized into five types:
>
> * <mark style="background-color:green;">Income</mark>: such as salary, etc.
> * <mark style="background-color:red;">Expense</mark>: such as food, entertainment, etc.
> * <mark style="background-color:yellow;">Asset</mark>: such as cash, bank, etc.
> * <mark style="background-color:purple;">Liability</mark>: such as credit card, loan, etc.
> * <mark style="background-color:blue;">Other</mark>: other types of accounts.
>
> Account names can be separated by dots (`.`) for better hierarchical display in the balance sheet.

## Transaction

> A Transaction records the transfer of amounts between different accounts, such as consumption, withdrawal, deposit, or credit card usage. Examples are as follows:
>
> * Salary deposited into the bank: from <mark style="background-color:green;">Income</mark> account (salary) to <mark style="background-color:yellow;">Asset</mark> account (bank), 68,000 units.
> * Withdrawing money from the bank: from <mark style="background-color:yellow;">Asset</mark> account (bank) to <mark style="background-color:yellow;">Asset</mark> account (cash), 10,000 units.
> * Using cash to eat: from <mark style="background-color:yellow;">Asset</mark> account (cash) to <mark style="background-color:red;">Expense</mark> account (food), 230 units.
> * Buying a phone with a credit card: from <mark style="background-color:purple;">Liability</mark> account (credit card) to <mark style="background-color:red;">Expense</mark> account (entertainment), 23,200 units.
> * Paying the credit card bill from the bank: from <mark style="background-color:yellow;">Asset</mark> account (bank) to <mark style="background-color:purple;">Liability</mark> account (credit card), 30,000 units.
